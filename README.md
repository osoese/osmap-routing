# Getting Started with Create React App

In this case I did not take the time to create react app and I skipped the initial typescript in favor of jsx. Project base was copypasta from [this person's stackblitz post](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-leaflet-routing-machine-core-api?file=src%2FApp.js) (thank you üëè).

I then moved the css from leaflep node_modules up to a src directory and started modding it as needed. I began working on a wrapper - changed the start and finish and map specifics and WIP adding other app elements.

# Adding an App around the Map for a Pwa

And so, as you join me on this journey you will see the app develop around the map. I have added
a basic header and footer and am styling the footer to incorperate the BEIR coin inventory and
cart elements. I will leave it at that for now...
