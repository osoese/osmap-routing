# Getting Started with Create React App

Project base was copypasta from [npm install](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-leaflet-routing-machine-core-api?file=src%2FApp.js). I then moved the css up and start modding it and working on a wrapper - changed the start and finish and map specifics and WIP adding other app elements
